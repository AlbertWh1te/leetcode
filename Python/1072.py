# 1072. Flip Columns For Maximum Number of Equal Rows


# Given a matrix consisting of 0s and 1s,
# we may choose any number of columns in the matrix and flip every cell in that column.
# Flipping a cell changes the value of that cell from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.

# Return the maximum number of rows that have all values equal after some number of flips.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: [[0,1],[1,1]]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: After flipping no values, 1 row has all values equal.
# Example 2:

# Input: [[0,1],[1,0]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: After flipping values in the first column, both rows have equal values.
# Example 3:

# Input: [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,0]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: After flipping values in the first two columns, the last two rows have equal values.

    we don't need to truly flipped the columns,there is two case we can get the right result
        case 1: They are the same before the flipping, e.g. [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]].
        case 2: They are one's complement for each other before the flipping e.g. [0,0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,1,1]]. 

    so the key point is understand what we need memory is the pattern  [0,0,1] and [1,1,0] is the same pattern
    we can record all of pattern into a hash table and return the max one
