# 84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram

# Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height
#  where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

# Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].

# The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

# Example:

# Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
# Output: 10

# Solution:

from typing import List
