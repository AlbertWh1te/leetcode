# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
# Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

# Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
# Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
# Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.

# Solution
# 1) Get count of the nodes in the first list, let count be c1.
# 2) Get count of the nodes in the second list, let count be c2.
# 3) Get the difference of counts d = abs(c1 â€“ c2)
# 4) Now traverse the bigger list from the first node till d nodes so that from here onwards both the lists have equal no of nodes.
# 5) Then we can traverse both the lists in parallel till we come across a common node. (Note that getting a common node is done by comparing the address of the nodes)
